# ECS network

Creates networking resources needed for a standard ECS cluster setup:

1. A single VPC with Internet Gateway
2. Public and private subnet in each availability zone
3. NAT Gateway in each public subnet for outbound traffic
4. Application Load Balancer for inbound traffic with HTTP and HTTPS listeners
5. Bastion hosts for accessing hosts within the private subnets

# To do

- [ ] S3 bucket for ALB Logs
