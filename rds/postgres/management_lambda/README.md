# rds/postgres/management_lambda

Creates an AWS Lambda function which can be used to manage the RDS instance:

- create/drop users
- create/drop databases

## Contributing

Since it would be unreasonable to require a working installation of node.js on every machine that wants to apply the module, a compiled version of lambda's code is put in the `./dist` directory and included in the repository.

Remember to always run `npm run build` before committing any changes in `src`, so `src` and `dist` are kept in sync.

> **To do**
>
> Figure out a better way to handle this or at least add a CI step to verify `dist` is up-to-date.
